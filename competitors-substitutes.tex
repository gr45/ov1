\subsection{Competitors and Substitutes}

As far as competitors and substitutes goes, there are services available, such as Trafikanten and Bussoraklet. Many of the transportation service providers also offer their own travel planning service, Norwegian and NSB amongst others. The mentioned services, however, are all lacking in one way or another. The transportation providers' own services have the obvious flaw of only containing their own services, leaving you to check each other provider separately to find the best alternative. Services such as Bussoraklet only cover one means of travel (in this case, bus), and most of these services are limited in the area that they cover. Trafikanten, for instance, only covers travel in Oslo and Ã˜stfold.

Our biggest competition that we have been able to locate, is rutebok.no. However, we experience their algorithm to be inadequate, as we cannot find all desired means of travel for the various voyages we tested on their site. On the basis of the market survey we conducted, as well as our own desires, we don't find all the necessary or desired functionality in their service, such as sorting on any chosen criteria. Nor do we find the design of this service to be sufficiently good. Based on these experiences, we believe our service would be a strong competitor.
